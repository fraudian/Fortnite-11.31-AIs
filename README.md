## üìÇ **Fortnite 11.31 AI's**
- This Repo includes the DLL AND Source Code that allows you to play with AI's in Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 1, This DLL has been gatekept by Modders since 2023 so I'm leaking it to piss them off because gatekeeping a file is stupid :)

- I also saw a video of Milxnor Showcasing his Mod he created for Chapter 2 Season 2 and I saw LOTS of comments of people asking for a release (to which he rightfully said no due to it being a personal project) and it reminded me I have a DLL that does something similar so why not release it?
